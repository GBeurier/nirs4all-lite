"""``n4a`` -- additive brand facade over the nirs4all aggregate distribution.

``n4a`` is the short, brand-aligned import root ("n4a" = nirs4all) for the
portable nirs4all aggregate. It re-exports the full public surface of the
aggregate -- shipped today as the ``nirs4all-lite`` distribution / the
``nirs4all_lite`` import package -- and adds no behavior of its own. Importing
``n4a`` is equivalent to importing the aggregate::

    import n4a

    n4a.upstream_status()
    n4a.load_pipeline_definition(config)

LOCK-GOV / GOV-004 naming note: the ``n4a`` stem appears in three distinct
places across the ecosystem. They are intentionally consistent ("n4a" =
"nirs4all") but address different layers:

* ``n4a`` (this module) -- the Python *import facade* for the aggregate;
* ``.n4a`` -- the pipeline/bundle *file extension* used by the full
  ``nirs4all`` library;
* ``n4a-datasets`` -- the *console script* shipped by ``nirs4all-datasets``.

This facade is additive: it does not remove, rename, or shadow the existing
``nirs4all_lite`` import surface, and it deliberately does not shadow the full
Python ``nirs4all`` library.
