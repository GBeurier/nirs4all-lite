"""``nirs4all_core`` -- release-gated core facade for the aggregate.

LOCK-GOV direction (target-state): the portable nirs4all aggregate -- shipped
today as the ``nirs4all-lite`` distribution (import ``nirs4all_lite``) -- is to
be promoted to ``nirs4all-core``. The actual distribution rename is gated on the
release lock (``LOCK-REL``) and is intentionally **not** performed in this
slice: the project keeps publishing the aggregate as ``nirs4all-lite`` and only
adds this additive ``nirs4all_core`` import alias so downstream code can adopt
the target import name early, without breakage.

The public ``nirs4all_core`` contract advertises only inspection, validation,
capability, release-topology, and facade APIs. Execution helpers from
``nirs4all_lite`` remain reachable through the compatibility passthrough, but
they are deliberately outside ``nirs4all_core.__all__`` so ``import *`` and
release manifest checks do not treat core as an execution engine.

Core-style imports are stable::

    import nirs4all_core as n4a_core

    n4a_core.upstream_status()
    n4a_core.load_pipeline_definition(config)

The legacy ``nirs4all_lite`` import surface is unchanged and fully supported.
