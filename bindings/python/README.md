# Python Binding

Distribution name: `nirs4all-lite`

Import name: `nirs4all_lite`

This binding intentionally avoids the `nirs4all` import name so it can be
installed next to the full Python `nirs4all` package during parity checks.

Additive import facades are available for governed topology work:

- `n4a` mirrors the full `nirs4all_lite` aggregate surface.
- `nirs4all_core` advertises the release-gated core contract only: inspection,
  validation, capability reporting, release topology, and facade access. Legacy
  execution helpers remain reachable through passthrough for compatibility, but
  are excluded from `nirs4all_core.__all__`.

## Portable Execution

`nirs4all_lite.run_portable_pipeline(source, dataset)` executes the shared
portable JSON/YAML subset through the `nirs4all-methods` Python bindings:

- `KennardStoneSplitter`
- `StandardNormalVariate` / `SNV`
- `SavitzkyGolay`
- `sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression`
- `_range_` sweeps over `n_components`

Savitzky-Golay defaults to `mode="interp"` for full Python nirs4all parity and
preserves explicit methods-backed modes (`mirror`, `constant`, `nearest`,
`wrap`, `interp`) plus `cval`.

The aggregate does not implement numerical kernels. Install the optional
methods extra, or make `n4m` and `pls4all` importable, before calling it:

```bash
python -m pip install "nirs4all-lite[methods]"
```

The strict local parity gate compares all shared fixtures against the full
Python `nirs4all` oracle and reports max prediction/RMSE deltas on failure:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=bindings/python/src:/path/to/nirs4all-methods/bindings/python/src \
PLS4ALL_LIB_PATH=/path/to/libn4m.so \
NIRS4ALL_LITE_REQUIRE_METHODS_PARITY=1 \
python -m unittest bindings/python/tests/test_execution_parity.py -v
```
