# Publishing Checklist

Package names to reserve or create:

| Target | Registry | Name | Artifact | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | PyPI | `nirs4all-core` | wheel + sdist from `bindings/python` | `release-python.yml` |
| JavaScript/WASM | npm | `nirs4all` | npm package from `bindings/wasm` | `release-npm.yml` |
| Rust | crates.io | `nirs4all` | crate from `bindings/rust/nirs4all` | `release-crates.yml` |
| R | CRAN / R-universe | `nirs4all` | source tarball from `bindings/r` | `release-r.yml` |
| MATLAB/Octave | GitHub Releases | `nirs4all-matlab-octave-<version>.zip` | zip from `bindings/matlab` | `release-matlab.yml` |
| Source + SBOM | GitHub Releases | `nirs4all-core-<version>-src.*` | git-archive + CycloneDX + SHA256SUMS | `release-source.yml` |

## How releases are cut

The single source of truth for the version is the **Rust crate**
(`bindings/rust/nirs4all/Cargo.toml`); `scripts/bump_version.sh` propagates it to
the Python, npm, and R manifests (with the spelling each ecosystem needs) and
`scripts/bump_version.sh --check` fails CI on drift.

On a **non-pre-release tag `vX.Y.Z`** the six `release-*.yml` workflows run and:

* publish **PyPI `nirs4all-core`** via **OIDC Trusted Publishing** (GitHub
  environment `pypi`, `id-token: write` — no API token),
* publish **npm `nirs4all`** (needs the `NPM_TOKEN` secret),
* publish **crates.io `nirs4all`** (needs the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret),
* build + attach the **R `nirs4all`** source tarball, the **MATLAB/Octave**
  zip, and the **source + SBOM** bundle to the GitHub Release.

A **pre-release tag** (anything with a `-`, e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha.1`) builds and
attaches artifacts but **publishes to no registry**. `workflow_dispatch` runs
every workflow in dry-run mode (build/validate only).

The PyPI Trusted Publisher must be created once by the maintainer for project
`nirs4all-core` with: owner `GBeurier`, repo `nirs4all-core`, workflow
`release-python.yml`, environment `pypi`. **Release blocker:** the
`nirs4all-core` project/publisher does not exist yet; the old `nirs4all-lite`
publisher does not carry over. The legacy `nirs4all-lite` PyPI project stays
installable — its final release becomes a thin alias depending on
`nirs4all-core` (see
[`CORE_RENAME.md`](CORE_RENAME.md) Phase R2); never yank existing versions.

`nirs4all-datasets` is **external/optional everywhere** and is never bundled: a
Python extra (`nirs4all-core[datasets]`, excluded from `[all]`), an R `Suggests`
(resolved from R-universe via `Additional_repositories`), an optional npm peer
dependency, and an off-by-default Cargo feature (`datasets`).

## Python / PyPI

Build:

```bash
python -m pip install build twine
python -m build bindings/python --outdir dist/python
python -m twine check dist/python/*
```

Publish after the PyPI project `nirs4all-core` exists and trusted publishing or
an API token is configured:

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/python/*
```

## npm

Build:

```bash
npm test --prefix bindings/wasm
npm pack ./bindings/wasm --pack-destination dist/npm
```

Publish after the npm package `nirs4all` is owned by the project:

```bash
npm publish dist/npm/nirs4all-*.tgz --access public
```

## Rust / crates.io

Validate:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo package -p nirs4all
```

Publish after the crate name `nirs4all` is reserved:

```bash
cargo publish -p nirs4all
```

## R / CRAN

Build and check:

```bash
mkdir -p dist/r
cd dist/r && R CMD build ../../bindings/r && cd ../..
R CMD check --as-cran dist/r/nirs4all_*.tar.gz
```

The R package is **pure R** (`NeedsCompilation: no`) — no Rust/cargo, so none of
the "Using Rust" CRAN considerations apply. `R CMD check --as-cran` is clean
(0 ERROR / 0 WARNING; one expected new-submission NOTE). It Imports only
`jsonlite` + `yaml`; the ecosystem bindings (`nirs4allformats`, `nirs4allio`,
`nirs4alldatasets`, `n4m`, `dagmldata`) are `Suggests`, resolved from R-universe
via `Additional_repositories`. Because those upstreams are not on mainstream
CRAN yet, the natural channel today is **R-universe**; the tarball is written
CRAN-submittable for when they land on CRAN. See
[`bindings/r/cran-comments.md`](https://github.com/GBeurier/nirs4all-core/blob/main/bindings/r/cran-comments.md).

`release-r.yml` builds and attaches `nirs4all_<version>.tar.gz` to the Release;
the maintainer downloads it and submits via CRAN's web form when appropriate.

## R-universe

R-universe is configured through `GBeurier/GBeurier.r-universe.dev`.
`packages.json` tracks this package as:

```json
{
  "package": "nirs4all",
  "url": "https://github.com/GBeurier/nirs4all-core",
  "subdir": "bindings/r"
}
```

Publish only after `R CMD check` is green in CI.

## MATLAB/Octave

Build:

```bash
scripts/build-matlab-package.sh dist/matlab
```

`release-matlab.yml` runs `make test-matlab-parity` against the pinned
`nirs4all-methods` ref before attaching the zip to the GitHub Release. A
`.mltbx` can be added later when the MATLAB toolbox metadata is ready; the
current portable artifact is Octave-safe.
