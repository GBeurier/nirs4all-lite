# `nirs4all-lite` → `nirs4all-core` rename runbook

> **Superseded policy note (2026-07-09):** the V1 RC target does not keep a
> public `nirs4all-lite` compatibility alias. This runbook is retained as a
> historical cutover record. Current publish and registry work happens from
> `GBeurier/nirs4all-core`; this checkout is audit/validation only.

This is the ordered, concrete procedure for promoting the aggregate from
`nirs4all-lite` to `nirs4all-core`. Originally drafted by the RC-E
language-surface lane as a
rename-readiness record; topology/naming ownership and the ecosystem-level
moves belong to the coordinator / RC-A.

> **Status (2026-07-02, RC-A):** **Phase R1 is executed** on the RC V1 head
> (`rc/v1-full-refactor-core`) per the RC V1 control-board decision that RC is
> the final topology. Exception: Phase R1 item 2 (canonical/alias package
> inversion) is deliberately deferred — the canonical import stays
> `nirs4all_lite` because the ecosystem release-lock consumes
> `bindings/python/src/nirs4all_lite/_topology.py` by path and must move in
> lockstep with any such inversion. The topology schema id was bumped to
> `nirs4all-core.release-topology.v2` (the shape changed: `future_id` →
> `legacy_id`, `target_distribution` → `legacy_distribution`); no code consumer
> pinned the old id — only the intentionally-stale committed aggregation lock,
> which is regenerated at final head selection. Phase R2 is partially executed:
> the GitHub repository and Read the Docs slug are now `nirs4all-core`. The
> remaining admin blocker is the PyPI `nirs4all-core` Trusted Publisher. The
> final `nirs4all-lite` alias release mentioned by earlier drafts is no longer
> part of the RC target.

Governance context: `SW2_GOV_CORE_NAMING_spec.md` (GOV-003/GOV-004),
`A13_A13-core-release.md` (DEC-GOV-001/002, staged T0→T2), and
[`NAMING.md`](NAMING.md). The direction is a *concept* rename whose only Python
distribution name is actually in question — Rust/npm/R/MATLAB already ship the
bare `nirs4all` name and are unaffected.

## Invariants that must hold at every step

1. **PyPI `nirs4all-core` is the only current Python aggregate publication.**
   Existing historical `nirs4all-lite` artifacts are not yanked, but no new
   public compatibility alias release is maintained for the RC target.
2. **Rust / npm / R / MATLAB are untouched.** They already use the bare
   `nirs4all` name (crate / npm package / `library(nirs4all)` / `+nirs4all`).
   The rename is Python-distribution-only.
3. **`nirs4all` stays reserved as a Python import.** The full Python `nirs4all`
   modelling library owns it until an intentional core cutover; neither
   `n4a`, `nirs4all_core`, nor `nirs4all_lite` may define a top-level `nirs4all`
   module.
4. **No behaviour fork.** `nirs4all-core` is the same code lineage, never a
   divergent re-implementation.

## Phase R1 — in-repo edits (EXECUTED by RC-A, except item 2)

1. `bindings/python/pyproject.toml` — **done**:
   - `name = "nirs4all-core"`;
   - self-referential extra flipped to `everything = ["nirs4all-core[all,datasets]"]`;
   - `[project.urls]` points to `GBeurier/nirs4all-core`;
   - the wheel `packages` list still ships `nirs4all_core`, `nirs4all_lite`,
     and `n4a` so invariant (1) holds (the old import keeps resolving).
2. Facade direction — **deferred** (see status note above): making
   `src/nirs4all_core` the canonical implementation and turning
   `src/nirs4all_lite/__init__.py` into the thin forwarding alias requires a
   lockstep update of the ecosystem release-lock artifact path
   (`aggregation-manifest.n4a.json` → `lite.contract_artifacts.release_topology_manifest.path`).
   `n4a` continues to re-export whichever package is canonical via
   `__aggregate_import__`.
3. `bindings/python/src/nirs4all_lite/_topology.py` — **done**:
   - `aggregate.id = "nirs4all-core"`, `legacy_id = "nirs4all-lite"`,
     `repo = "GBeurier/nirs4all-core"`, and
     `legacy_repo = "GBeurier/nirs4all-lite"`;
   - `python.distribution = "nirs4all-core"`, `canonical_import` unchanged
     (`nirs4all_lite`), `legacy_distribution_status = "superseded"`;
   - `install_distributions`: `nirs4all-core` -> `status = "current"` with
     `workflow = "release-python.yml"`; any `nirs4all-lite` row is retired
     historical metadata with no workflow/artifact;
   - schema id bumped to `nirs4all-core.release-topology.v2` (not a silent
     rename: shape changed, consumers audited — none pinned the old id).
4. Guard tests in `test_release_topology.py` flipped **in the same change** —
   **done**: they now assert the new canonical name and the retired
   `nirs4all-lite` row. `test_facade.py` unchanged (canonical/implementation
   `__name__`s did not swap; item 2 deferred).
5. Source/SBOM naming — **done**: `release-source.yml` prefix and the manifest
   row renamed `nirs4all-lite-source-sbom` → `nirs4all-core-source-sbom`
   (cosmetic; no new public legacy artifact alias is part of the RC target).
6. Cosmetic diagnostics sweep — **done**: the "outside the current
   nirs4all-lite portable subset" strings in `_pipeline.py`,
   `bindings/r/R/pipeline.R`, `bindings/rust/nirs4all/src/lib.rs`,
   `bindings/wasm/src/index.js`, and MATLAB now say `nirs4all-core`. These are
   diagnostics, not contracts.

## Phase R2 — coordinator / GitHub / registry actions (PARTIAL)

These require repository-admin or registry credentials and are recorded here:

- **GitHub repo**: `GBeurier/nirs4all-core` is the canonical repository. Keep
  `GBeurier/nirs4all-lite` only as a retired audit reference if it remains
  visible.
- **Ecosystem submodule pin** (owned by RC-A / coordinator): update the
  `nirs4all-ecosystem` submodule path/URL for the renamed repo.
- **PyPI**: register/claim `nirs4all-core` and create its Trusted Publisher
  (owner `GBeurier`, repo `nirs4all-core`, workflow `release-python.yml`,
  environment `pypi`); publish `nirs4all-core` from `release-python.yml`. Never
  yank existing historical `nirs4all-lite` versions, but do not publish a new
  alias wheel for the RC target.
- **Read the Docs**: `nirs4all-core` is the canonical slug; leave
  `nirs4all-lite` only as a retired historical reference if it remains
  configured.
- **Docs site / `nirs4all.org`**: install snippets updated on the org RC head
  (RC-A); that head must not deploy before the PyPI `nirs4all-core` publish.

## Phase R3 — verification (after R1 + R2)

- `pip install nirs4all-core` succeeds; `import nirs4all_core`, `import n4a`,
  and the retained implementation import `import nirs4all_lite` work from the
  core package; `import nirs4all` still resolves to the full library
  (invariant 3).
- `make test-python-v1-surfaces` passes with the flipped guard tests.
- Rust/npm/R/MATLAB gates unchanged and green (invariant 2).
- `release_topology_manifest()` reports `nirs4all-core` as `current` and any
  `nirs4all-lite` entry as retired/superseded, with no publish workflow.

## One-line status

Phase R1 is executed on the RC V1 head (canonical-import inversion deferred
with its lockstep requirement recorded). Remaining work is the PyPI Trusted
Publisher, then Phase R3 verification. No final legacy alias release is part of
the current RC target.
